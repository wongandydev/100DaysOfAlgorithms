# 100 Days Of Algorithms


### This is my attempt at 100 days of Algorithms 
Note: While doing this challenge, my goal is to learn another program langauge such as C and write algorithms using that new language instead. My goal is to switch the syntax every 20 days of algorithms. #challengeWithATwist

1. [15_GradingChallenge](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/15_GradingChallenge.java): 

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a *grade* in the inclusive range from **0** to **100**
* Any *grade* less than **40** is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's *grade* according to these rules:

* If the difference between the *grade* and the next multiple of **5** is less than **3**, round *grade* up to the next multiple of **5**
* If the value of *grade* is less than **38**, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, *grade* = **84** will be rounded to 85 but *grade* = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than **40**

Given the initial value of *grade* for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

Steve wants to reduce *s* as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and printing s's non-reducible form!

**Note:** If the final string is empty, print `Empty String`.
